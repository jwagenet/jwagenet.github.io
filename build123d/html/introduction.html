<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<section id="key-aspects">
<h2>Key Aspects<a class="headerlink" href="#key-aspects" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The following sections describe some of the key aspects of build123d and illustrate
why one might choose this open source system over proprietary options like SolidWorks,
OnShape, Fusion 360, or even other open source systems like Blender, or OpenSCAD.</p>
<section id="boundary-representation-brep-modelling">
<h3>Boundary Representation (BREP) Modelling<a class="headerlink" href="#boundary-representation-brep-modelling" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Boundary representation (BREP) and mesh-based CAD systems are both used to
create and manipulate 3D models, but they differ in the way they represent and
store the models.</p>
<p>Advantages of BREP-based CAD systems (e.g. build123d &amp; SolidWorks):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Precision: BREP-based CAD systems use mathematical representations to define
the shape of an object, which allows for more precise and accurate modeling of
complex shapes.</p></li>
<li><p>Topology: BREP-based CAD systems maintain topological information of the 3D
model, such as edges, faces and vertices. This allows for more robust and stable
modeling, such as Boolean operations.</p></li>
<li><p>Analytical modeling: BREP-based CAD systems can take advantage of the
topological information to perform analytical operations such as collision
detection, mass properties calculations, and finite element analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Features-based modeling: BREP-based CAD systems are often feature-based, which
means that the model is built by creating and modifying individual features,
such as holes, fillets, and chamfers. This allows for parametric design and easy
modification of the model.</p></li>
<li><p>Efficient storage: BREP-based CAD systems use a compact representation to
store the 3D model, which is more efficient than storing a large number of
triangles used in mesh-based systems.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages of Mesh-based CAD systems (e.g. Blender, OpenSCAD):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Simplicity: Mesh-based CAD systems use a large number of triangles to
represent the surface of an object, which makes them easy to use and understand.</p></li>
<li><p>Real-time rendering: Mesh-based CAD systems can be rendered in real-time,
which is useful for applications such as video games and virtual reality.</p></li>
<li><p>Flexibility: Mesh-based CAD systems can be easily exported to other 3D
modeling and animation software, which makes them a good choice for use in the
entertainment industry.</p></li>
<li><p>Handling of freeform surfaces: Mesh-based systems are better equipped to
handle freeform surfaces, such as those found in organic shapes, as they do not
rely on mathematical representation.</p></li>
<li><p>Handling of large datasets: Mesh-based systems are more suitable for handling
large datasets such as point clouds, as they can be easily converted into a mesh
representation.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="parameterized-models">
<h3>Parameterized Models<a class="headerlink" href="#parameterized-models" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Parametrized CAD systems are more effective than non-parametric CAD systems in
several ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Reusability: Parametrized CAD models can be easily modified by changing a set
of parameters, such as the length or width of an object, rather than having to
manually edit the geometry. This makes it easy to create variations of a design
without having to start from scratch.</p></li>
<li><p>Design exploration: Parametrized CAD systems allow for easy exploration of
different design options by changing the parameters and quickly visualizing the
results.  This can save a lot of time and effort during the design process.</p></li>
<li><p>Constraints and relationships: Parametrized CAD systems allow for the
definition of constraints and relationships between different parameters. This
ensures that the model remains valid and functional even when parameters are
changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Automation: Parametrized CAD systems can be automated to perform repetitive
tasks, such as generating detailed drawings or creating parts lists. This can
save a lot of time and effort and reduce the risk of errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaboration: Parametrized CAD systems allow different team members to work
on different aspects of a design simultaneously and ensure that the model
remains consistent across different stages of the development process.</p></li>
<li><p>Document management: Parametrized CAD systems can generate engineering
drawings, BOMs, and other documents automatically, which makes it easier to
manage and track the design history.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, parametrized CAD systems are more effective than non-parametric CAD
systems because they provide a more efficient and flexible way to create and
modify designs, and can be easily integrated into the design, manufacturing, and
documentation process.</p>

free to use and distribute.  This makes it accessible to developers of all
levels and budgets.</p></li>
<li><p>Large number of libraries and modules: Python has a vast collection of
libraries and modules that make it easy to accomplish complex tasks such as
connecting to web servers, reading and modifying files, and connecting to
databases.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="open-source-software">
<h3>Open Source Software<a class="headerlink" href="#open-source-software" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Open source and proprietary software systems are different in several ways: B
Licensing: Open source software is licensed in a way that allows users to view,
modify, and distribute the source code, while proprietary software is closed
source and the source code is not available to the public.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Ownership: Open source software is usually developed and maintained by a
community of developers, while proprietary software is owned by a company or
individual.</p></li>
<li><p>Cost: Open source software is typically free to use, while proprietary
software may require payment for a license or subscription.  Customization: Open
source software can be modified and customized by users and developers, while
proprietary software is typically not modifiable by users.</p></li>
<li><p>Support: Open source software may have a larger community of users who can
provide support, while proprietary software may have a smaller community and
relies on the company for support.  Security: Open source software can be
audited by a large community of developers, which can make it more secure, while
proprietary software may have fewer eyes on the code and may be more vulnerable
to security issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Interoperability: Open source software may have better interoperability with
other software and platforms, while proprietary software may have more limited
compatibility.</p></li>
<li><p>Reliability: Open source software can be considered as reliable as proprietary
software. It is usually used by large companies, governments, and organizations
and has been tested by a large number of users.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, open source and proprietary software systems are different in terms
of licensing, ownership, cost, customization, support, security,
interoperability, and reliability. Open source software is typically free to use
and can be modified by users and developers, while proprietary software is
closed-source and may require payment for a license or subscription. Open source
software may have a larger community of users who can provide support, while
proprietary software may have a smaller community and relies on the company for
support.</p>

<section id="source-code-control-systems">
<h3>Source Code Control Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#source-code-control-systems" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Most GUI based CAD systems provide version control systems which represent the
CAD design and its history. They allows developers to see changes made to the design
over time, in a format that is easy to understand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a source code control system like Git, is a command-line tool
and it provides more granular control over the code. This makes it suitable for
more advanced users and developers who are comfortable working with command-line
interfaces. A source code control system like Git is more flexible and allows
developers to perform tasks like branching and merging, which are not easily
done with a GUI version control system. Systems like Git have several advantages,
including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Version control: Git allows developers to keep track of changes made to the
code over time, making it easy to revert to a previous version if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaboration: Git makes it easy for multiple developers to work on the same
codebase simultaneously, with the ability to merge changes from different
branches of development.</p></li>
<li><p>Backup: Git provides a way to backup and store the codebase in a remote
repository, like GitHub. This can serve as a disaster recovery mechanism, in
case of data loss.</p></li>
<li><p>Branching: Git allows developers to create multiple branches of a project for
different features or bug fixes, which can be easily merged into the main
codebase once they are complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Auditing: Git allows you to see who made changes to the code, when and what
changes were made, which is useful for auditing and debugging.</p></li>
<li><p>Open-source development: Git makes it easy for open-source developers to
contribute to a project and share their work with the community.</p></li>
<li><p>Flexibility: Git is a distributed version control system, which means that
developers can work independently and offline.  They can then push their changes
to a remote repository when they are ready to share them with others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, GUI version control systems are generally more user-friendly and
easier to use, while source code control systems like Git offer more flexibility
and control over the code. Both can be used to achieve the same goal, but they
cater to different types of users and use cases.</p>
</section>
<section id="automated-testing">
<h3>Automated Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#automated-testing" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Users of source based CAD systems can benefit from automated testing which improves
their source code by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Finding bugs: Automated tests can detect bugs in the code, which can then be
fixed before the code is released.  This helps to ensure that the code is of
higher quality and less likely to cause issues when used.</p></li>
<li><p>Regression testing: Automated tests can be used to detect regressions, which
are bugs that are introduced by changes to the codebase. This helps to ensure
that changes to the code do not break existing functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>Documenting code behavior: Automated tests can serve as documentation for how
the code is supposed to behave. This makes it easier for developers to
understand the code and make changes without breaking it.</p></li>
<li><p>Improving code design: Writing automated tests often requires a good
understanding of the code and how it is supposed to behave. This can lead to a
better design of the code, as developers will have a better understanding of the
requirements and constraints.</p></li>
<li><p>Saving time and cost: Automated testing can save time and cost by reducing the
need for manual testing. Automated tests can be run quickly and often, which
means that bugs can be found and fixed early in the development process, which
is less expensive than finding them later.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous integration and delivery: Automated testing can be integrated into
a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. This means that tests
are run automatically every time code is committed and can be integrated with
other tools such as code coverage, static analysis and more.</p></li>
<li><p>Improving maintainability: Automated tests can improve the maintainability of
the code by making it easier to refactor and change the codebase. This is
because automated tests provide a safety net that ensures that changes to the
code do not introduce new bugs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, automated testing is an essential part of the software development
process, it helps to improve the quality of the code by detecting bugs early,
documenting code behavior, and reducing the cost of maintaining and updating the
code.</p>

<p>The use of the standard <cite>with</cite> block allows standard python instructions to be
inserted anyway in the code flow.  One can insert a CQ-editor <cite>debug</cite> or standard <cite>print</cite>
statement anywhere in the code without impacting functionality. Simple python
<cite>for</cite> loops can be used to repetitively create objects instead of forcing users
into using more complex <cite>lambda</cite> and <cite>iter</cite> operations.</p>

<h3>Instantiated Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#instantiated-objects" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Each object and operation is now a class instantiation that interacts with the
active context implicitly for the user. These instantiations can be assigned to
an instance variable as with standard python programming for direct use.</p>

<h3>Operators<a class="headerlink" href="#operators" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>New operators have been created to extract information from objects created previously
in the code. The <cite>&#64;</cite> operator extracts the position along an Edge or Wire while the
<cite>%</cite> operator extracts the tangent along an Edge or Wire. The position parameter are float
values between 0.0 and 1.0 which represent the beginning and end of the line. In the following
example, a spline is created from the end of l5 (<cite>l5 &#64; 1</cite>) to the beginning of l6 (<cite>l6 &#64; 0</cite>)
with tangents equal to the tangents of l5 and l6 at their end and beginning respectively.
Being able to extract information from existing features allows the user to “snap” new
features to these points without knowing their numeric values.</p>

<h3>Last Operation Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#last-operation-objects" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>All of the <cite>vertices()</cite>, <cite>edges()</cite>, <cite>faces()</cite>, and <cite>solids()</cite> methods of the builders
can either return all of the objects requested or just the objects changed during the
last operation. This allows the user to easily access features for further refinement,
as shown in the following code where the final line selects the edges that were added
by the last operation and fillets them. Such a selection would be quite difficult
otherwise.</p>

<h3>Extensions<a class="headerlink" href="#extensions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Extending build123d is relatively simple in that custom objects or operations
can be created as new classes without the need to monkey patch any of the
core functionality. These new classes will be seen in IDEs which is not
possible with monkey patching the core CadQuery classes.</p>

<section id="enums">
<h3>Enums<a class="headerlink" href="#enums" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>All <cite>Literal</cite> strings have been replaced with <cite>Enum</cite> which allows IDEs to
prompt users for valid options without having to refer to documentation.</p>

<h3>Selectors replaced by Lists<a class="headerlink" href="#selectors-replaced-by-lists" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>String based selectors have been replaced with standard python filters and
sorting which opens up the full functionality of python lists. To aid the
user, common operations have been optimized as shown here along with
a fully custom selection:</p>
