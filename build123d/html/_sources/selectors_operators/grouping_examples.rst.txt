.. _grouping_axis:

Axis and Length
==================

This heatsink component could use fillets on the ends of the fins on the long ends. One
way to accomplish this might be by filtering by length, sorting by axis, and slicing the
result knowing how many edges to expect.

.. dropdown:: Setup

    .. code-block:: python

        from build123d import *

        with BuildPart() as fins:
            with GridLocations(4, 6, 4, 4):
                Box(2, 3, 10, align=(Align.CENTER, Align.CENTER, Align.MIN))

        with BuildPart() as part:
            Box(34, 48, 5, align=(Align.CENTER, Align.CENTER, Align.MAX))
            with GridLocations(20, 27, 2, 2):
                add(fins)

However, `group_by` can be used to first group all the edges by z-axis position and then
group again by length. In both cases, the last group can be used to select the desired
edges.

.. code-block:: python

    target = part.edges().group_by(Axis.Z)[-1].group_by(Edge.length)[-1]
    fillet(target, .75)

    :align: center

.. _grouping_properties_with_keys:

Properties with Keys
====================

Groups are most selected by list slice, often smallest ``[0]`` or largest ``[-1]``,
but they can also be selected by key with the ``group`` method if the keys are known.
Beginning with an incomplete bearing block we are looking to add fillets to the ribs
and corners. We know the edge lengths so the edges can be grouped by ``Edge.Length`` and
then the desired groups are selected with the ``group`` method using the lengths as keys.

.. dropdown:: Setup

    .. literalinclude:: examples/group_properties_with_keys.py
        :language: python
        :lines: 4, 10-26

    :language: python
    :lines: 30, 31

.. image:: ../assets/selectors_operators/group_length_key.png
    :align: center

Next up is adding alignment pin and counterbore holes after the fillets to make sure
screw heads sit flush where they overlap the fillet. Once that is done, its time to
finalize the tight tolerance bearing and pin holes with chamfers to make installation
easier. We can filter by ``GeomType.CIRCLE`` and group by ``Edge.radius`` to group the
circular edges. Again, the radii are known, so we can get those groups directly and then
further specify only the edges the bearings and pins are installed from.

It's worth noting ``group_by`` is not the only way to capture edges with a known property
value! ``filter_by`` with a lambda expression can be used as well:

.. code-block:: python

    radius_groups = part.edges().filter_by(GeomType.CIRCLE)
    bearing_edges = radius_groups.filter_by(lambda e: e.radius == 8)
    pin_edges = radius_groups.filter_by(lambda e: e.radius == 1.5)
